Welcome to the documentation blog for the *IDIA Pipelines* project. 

This project was formulated in response to the IDIA call for proposals, and focuses on one of the
key work themes conducted at IDIA -- the calibration and imaging of radio interferometric data, with
a clear emphasis on developing automated/semi-automated pipelines and workflows for MeerKAT data.

There are four MeerKAT Large Survey Projects (LSPs) that are involved in this collaboration:
* MIGHTEE
* LADUMA
* MHONGOOSE
* The Fornax Survey

These LSPs share many scientific and technical synergies, and the Pipelines Project provides a home
for the members of these LSPs to collaborate on the technical issues relevant to science delivery.

This documentation website aims to provide information on the following: 
* How to connect to IDIA machines via the Jupyter-Hub or SSH. 
* Using Singularity containers to manage and deploy software.
