The success of the IDIA Pipelines project relies on collaboration and transparency. To this end,
I've provided two locations for documentation and information exchange.

Firstly, I need to mention that the spirit of collaboration and transparency is one of the prime
drivers for the use of the Jupyter-Hub and Jupyter Notebooks. This is a great way to share recipes,
knowledge and documentation. Collaborators can download notebooks with code and markdown cells as
notebooks that can be shared and uploaded by other users; they can export notebooks as html pages,
scripts and static PDF documents. 

However, we also use conventional channels to collaborate and share information.  In particular,
this website ([https://idia-pipelines.github.io/][https://idia-pipelines.github.io/]) is meant to
provide documentation and **slow** information.  The associated GitHub [wiki][[idia-pipelines-wiki]
is aimed to provide a space for **fast** information -- notes, discussion, logs, reports and
recipes. 

A graphical representation of the [User Model][/model/] is provided on this website.
