The success of the IDIA Pipelines project relies on collaboration and transparency. In this website
we provide documentation on how to access IDIA machines and how to use singularity containers, but
the project uses a combination of tools for sharing knowledge.

The Jupyter-Hub interface is a great way to share recipes, knowledge and documentation. However, we
also use conventional channels to collaborate and share information.  In particular, this github io
website is meant to provide documentation and **slow** information.  The associated github wiki is
aimed to provide a space for **fast** information -- notes, discussion, logs, reports and recipes.
