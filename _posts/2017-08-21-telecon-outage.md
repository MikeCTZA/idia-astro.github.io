Hi Everyone!

Here's a short update on a few important issues relating to the IDIA Pipelines project.

### VM Outage
You may have noticed interruptions or complete outages of the IDIA Pipelines machines. This was due
to an internal reconfiguration of the storage volumes, which had a knock-on effect on the BeeGFS
volumes that we use extensively. 

As a result, all machines hosted on the ARC or IDIA domains were unreachable since sometime on
Thursday 17 August 2017. 

Connectivity is slowly being re-established and our services are being reinstated, so please be
patient while the system gets back up to full capacity. 

### IDIA Pipelines Telecon
I would like to thank all those who have participated in the poll for our upcoming telecon. The
telecon is scheduled for *3PM-SAST on Thursday 24 August 2017*. We will use _Skype_ for the telecon,
and please contact me directly to provide me with your ID if you aren't already in my address book. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Regards, brad
