Models of the MeerKAT primary beams have kindly been provided by Khan bin Assad and Mattieu de Villiers 
from Rhodes/SKA-SA, and have been uploaded to the shared storage.

There are two beams available, and they can be found in the following shared directory on our VMs:
`/data/share/AR1.5_June_MKAT_Files/meerkat_pb/`. In this directory, you will find the following
_fits_ images:

* 3-Degree beam, in Stokes-I:
    * `1487813282_beam_Zernike_model_1400MHz_3deg.fits`.
* Wide-Field Beam, in Full Stokes:
    * `1487813282_m000_256px_856MHz_1MHz_857channels_Jones_zern_trunc.fits`.
                                                                                                      
Models are created using Zernike polynomials fitted to holography data. For technical details on how
these beams have been generated, consult Khan's [IPython Notebook][ipynb].

*Note on Keywords:*
* `NAXIS3` and `NAXIS4` constitute the 2x2 Jones matrix.
* `NAXIS6` is for the real and imag parts.
