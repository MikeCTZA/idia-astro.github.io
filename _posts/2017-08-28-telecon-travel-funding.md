### Telecon
We had our first IDIA-Pipelines telecon on Thursday 24 August 2017, at 3pm. We had the following
attendees: 
* Brad (UCT). 
* David Aikema (UCT).
* Sarah Blyth (UCT). 
* Ian Heywood (Oxford). 
* Erwin de Blok (ASTRON). 

The following issues were highlighted/discussed:
* The IDIA trusted machines were back up, after the storage reconfiguration.
* Access via https (Jupyter-Hub) and ssh is available. 
    * Both Ian and Erwin have been able to login. 
    * Notebooks are the preferred way to work, but SSH is also available.
* Software containers are available, *KERN-2*, in particular. Source finding containers to follow.
    * An updated version of *KATDAL* has been installed. This addresses the flipped UVW coordinates
      that was produced by the old version. A new _DEEP2_ MS has been generated, and will be tested
      shortly. In the meantime, it looks like the *CASA* task `FIXVIS` fixes the problem.
* MeerKAT beams have been uploaded to the shared folder.
* Erwin has been transferring data from IDIA to ASTRON; Tom and Erwin have been investigating
  MeerKAT data using their own local tools.
    * There has been some progress on the data transfer demo under the "Dome" project. Erwin will be
      pushing this forward on the ASTRON side, in collaboration with Yan Grange.

### Upcoming Events in Cape Town
November 2017 will be a busy period for radio astronomers. There are several workshops
and conferences that will be of interest.
* [Astroinformatics 2017][astroinf], 7-10 November 2017.
* [.Astronomy 9][dotastro], 14-17 November 2017.
* SPARCS Data Processing Hackathons, 14/15 November 2017.
    * Currently being planned.
* MeerKAT Data Processing Workshop, 20-24 November 2017.

We are planning to reserve a few (busy-) weeks during October for concerted efforts related to the
IDIA pipelines work. In particular, we are hoping to work on the analysis of MeerKAT data and the
development of the basic parts of the execution framework. We are thus pleased to announce that we
will be able to provide financial support for _Ninja's_ who will be able to join us in October for
the busy weeks. 

### Travel Funding for Ninja Team
We will be able to provide financial support for members of the Ninja team who will be able to visit
us during October/November 2017, to work on MeerKAT data using the IDIA facility. 

The funding will cover the costs of the return flights and the accommodation during a two-weeks stay
in Cape Town. For more information, please contact Brad or Russ.
