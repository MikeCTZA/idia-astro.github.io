The IDIA-Pipelines Project focuses on the development and testing of imaging pipelines for the
[MeerKAT][meerkat] Large Survey Projects, and uses the cloud-based computing facilities available at the
[Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy][idia]. 

Dr. Bradley Frank [bradley@idia.ac.za][brad] is the coordinator for the Pipelines project.
